// A class for selection of configurations (active learning) for learning based on Maxvol algorithm
// USAGE: there are two options:
//  1.  Selecting configurations one-by-one (guarantees that no extrapolation occurs on the treated configurations, 
//      not guarantees construction the training set of maximum volume)
//      - just call .Select(cfg) method
//  2.  Selecting from the set of configurations or multiple selection (guarantees no extrapolation on the treated configurations, 
//      guarantees construction the training set of maximum volume)
//      - 1) commit configurations one-by-one for selection via .AddForSelection(cfg) method
//        2) call .Select() method to construct the selected set
// Specific of parallel treatment:
//      - Both implementation of .Select(...) method involve collective operations and should be called on ALL processors.
//      - If the number of configurations is not exact division of the number of processors 
//          a void (i.e. of zero size) configuration can be used
//      - When selecting configurations one-by-one different configurations on different processors 
//          can be put as argument for .Select(cfg) method. 
//          In this case the result is equivalent to multiple selection of mpi_size configuration on a sigle process.
//      - Selected set and the set of commited configurations (in multiple selection) is distributed among processors. 
//      - Configurations are not transfered between processors. 
//          Therefore the number of configuration (as selected as committed) can by different on each processor.
// Structure and principles of functioning:
//      - Each configuration produce one or more matrix rows that are selected in Maxvol routine.
//      - The first thing is done while selection or calculating the grade is calculation of matrix rows for a given configuration.
//          It is done in .Grade(), .AddForSelection(cfg) and .Select(cfg) routines. 
//      - in case of multiple selection and in single selection when 'threshold_select' exceeded 
//          the selecting configurations are copied and stored in cfgs_queue.
//      - The 'eqn2cfg_links' stores for each row
//          * a pointer to the producing configuration,
//          * the index of a particular equation (energy equation has index 0, 
//                                                  forces equations have 1 - 3*cfg.size() indices, 
//                                                  stress equations have 3*cfg.size()+1 - 3*cfg.size()+10 indices)
//                                                  site energy equations have 3*cfg.size()+1 - 3*cfg.size()+10 indices),
//          * mpi_rank of processor, on which the corresponding configuration is hosted.
//      - Different rows of 'eqn2cfg_links' can point to the same configuration but must have different equation indices.
//          'eqn2cfg_links' stores the data for selected configurations as well as for candidates. 
//          Selected rows occupy the first p_mlip->CoeffCount() positions.
//      - In the very beginning the following data is set eqn2cfg_links[i].p_cfg == nullptr,
//                                                          eqn2cfg_links[i].ind == -1,
//                                                          eqn2cfg_links[i].mpi_at_rank == i % mpi_rank.
//      - eqn2cfg_links.ind holds the proper value only at the processor where the corresponding configuration is hosted,
//          otherwise eqn2cfg_links.ind == -1 and eqn2cfg_links.p_cfg == nullptr.
//      - The configuration selection process is based on the swap rows history (storing the numbers of swapped rows)
//          after Maxvol algorithm maximized the matrix volume. 
//          According to the swap history. The configurations are moving between 'cfgs_queue' and 'selected_cfgs'.
//          At the same time the records in 'eqn2cfg_links' are also swapping, whereas pointer to configurations, 
//              equation indices and the rank of hosting processor kepps unchanged 
//              (that is why use of std::list for storage of configurations is important). 
//      - After selection ends the rest of eqn2cfg_links is deleted, cfgs_queue is cleared.
//      - 'track_changes' option is required for fast retraining while LOTF. 
//              It enables to obtain the changes in 'selected_set' after each selection event.
//      - When loading the state of the selecing object from a file thresholds are not loaded
//      - After loading the state of the selecing object from a file 
//          the selected configurations are distributed nearly eventually among processors, 
//          that may not coinside with their occupation when saving the state.
