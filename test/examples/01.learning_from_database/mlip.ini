mlip					TRUE			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load_from			mlip.mtp		# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
fit					TRUE			# <bool> 	Enables/disables MTP learning
	fit:save_to			out/mlipfitted.mtp	# <string> 	Output MTP file name (for trained MTP)
	fit:energy_weight		1.0			# <double> 	Weight for energy equation in fitting procedure
	fit:force_weight		0.001			# <double> 	Weight for forces equations in fitting procedure
	fit:stress_weight		0.1			# <double> 	Weight for stresses equations in fitting procedure
	fit:weight_scaling		1			# <double> 	Indicates how the weights for energy and stresses equations are scaled with the number of atoms. The corresponded weight is divided by the number of atoms in the power of (fit:weight_scaling_energy / 2)
	fit:weight_scaling_forces	0			# <double> 	Indicates how the weights for forces equation is scaled with the number of atoms. The corresponded weight is divided by the number of atoms in the power of (fit:weight_scaling_forces / 2)
	fit:reset_parameters		FALSE			# <bool>   	Start fitting from the current values of parameters if false. Otherwise they will be reset according to 'skip_preinit'
	fit:init_random			FALSE			# <bool>   	Coefficients will be initialized randomly if true
	fit:no_mindist_update		FALSE			# <bool>   	'mindist' parameter will be taken from the training set if true
	fit:iteration_limit		10			# <int>		Maximal number of iterations
	fit:log				stdout			# <string> 	Where to write fitting log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
