abinitio					void			# <string>	Defines Ab-initio model
	# void - EFS data should be provided				#		Used if driver provides EFS data with configurations. No additional EFS calculation is performed

mlip						mtp			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load-from				3basis_func.mtp		# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
fit				TRUE			# <bool> 	Enables/disables MTP learning
	fit:save			out/MTP100-fitted.mtp	# <string> 	Output MTP file name (for trained MTP)
	fit:energy-weight		1.0			# <double> 	Weight for energy equation in fitting procedure
	fit:force-weight		0.001			# <double> 	Weight for forces equations in fitting procedure
	fit:stress-weight		0.1			# <double> 	Weight for stresses equations in fitting procedure
	fit:scale-by-force		0.0			# <double> 	If greater than zero, large forces will be fitted less accurate than small 
	fit:log			stdout			# <string> 	Where to write fitting log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name

driver						1			# <0-2> 	Defines the configuration driver. Makes no sense if external driver is attached
	# 1 - read configurations from database file			#
	driver:cfg-reader:filename		trainset.cfg		# <string>	Configuration file name 
	driver:cfg-reader:log			stdout			# <string> 	Where to write reading log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
