mlip				TRUE		# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load_from		fitted.mtp	# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)

calculate_efs			TRUE		# <bool> 	Enables/disables EFS calculation by MTP (disabled learning may be usefull in pure learning/selection regime for best performance)
check_errors			TRUE		# <string>	If present enables comparison and accumulation of error statistics for EFS calculated by ab-initio model and MTP. Requires specified ab-initio model. Value indicates where to write log of learning on the fly process. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
check_errors:report_to		stdout		# <string>    Report will be saved to this file (or outputed on screen if "stdout" or "stderr" specified).
check_errors:log		out/errors.log	# <string>    Indicates where to write log with EFS differences for each configuration. "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams
