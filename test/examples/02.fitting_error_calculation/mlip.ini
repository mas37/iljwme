abinitio					void			# <string>	Defines Ab-initio model
	# void - EFS data should be provided				#		Used if driver provides EFS data with configurations. No additional EFS calculation is performed

mlip						mtp			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load-from				fitted.mtp	# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
calculate-efs			TRUE			# <bool> 	Enables/disables EFS calculation by MTP (disabled learning may be usefull in pure learning/selection regime for best performance)
check-errors			out/errors.log		# <string>	If present enables comparison and accumulation of error statistics for EFS calculated by ab-initio model and MTP. Requires specified ab-initio model. Value indicates where to write log of learning on the fly process. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
