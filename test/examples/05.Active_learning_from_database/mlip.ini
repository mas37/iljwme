abinitio					void			# <string>	Defines Ab-initio model
	# void - EFS data should be provided				#		Used if driver provides EFS data with configurations. No additional EFS calculation is performed

mlip						mtp			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load-from				unfitted.mtp		# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
fit				TRUE			# <bool> 	Enables/disables MTP learning
	fit:save			out/fitted.mtp	# <string> 	Output MTP file name (for trained MTP)
	fit:energy-weight		1.0			# <double> 	Weight for energy equation in fitting procedure
	fit:forces-weight		1.0			# <double> 	Weight for forces equations in fitting procedure
	fit:stress-weight		10.0			# <double> 	Weight for stresses equations in fitting procedure
	fit:scale-by-force		0.0			# <double> 	If greater than zero, large forces will be fitted less accurate than small 
	fit:log			stdout			# <string> 	Where to write fitting log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
select				TRUE			# <bool> 	Activates/deactivates selection (active learning engine)
	select:site-en-weight	1.0			# <double>	Weight for site energy equations in selection procedure
	select:energy-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for energy equation in selection procedure
	select:force-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for forces equations in selection procedure
	select:stress-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for stresses equations in selection procedure
	select:threshold		1.000001		# <double>	Selection threshold - maximum allowed extrapolation level
	select:save-selected	out/TS100.cfg 		# <string>	Selected configurations will be saved in this file after selection is complete. No configuration saving if not specified
	select:efs-ignored		TRUE	                # <bool>	Indicates that driver actually does not need EFS to be calculated (e.g. in fitting scenario). "TRUE" value may speed up processing by skipping some extra EFS calculations 
	select:log			stdout			# <string>	Where to write selection log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
