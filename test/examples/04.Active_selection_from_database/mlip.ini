mlip					TRUE			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load_from			fitted.mtp		# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
select					TRUE			# <bool> 	Activates/deactivates selection (active learning engine)
	select:site_en_weight		0.0			# <double>	Weight for site energy equations in selection procedure
	select:energy_weight		1.0			# <double>	Weight for energy equation in selection procedure
	select:force_weight		0.0			# <double>	Weight for forces equations in selection procedure
