mlip						mtp			# <string>	MLIP type: "MTP" or "void"
	mlip:load-from				unfitted.mtp		# <string> 	Filename with MTP. If not specified driver operates directly with Ab-Initio model (without additional routines)
select				TRUE			# <bool> 	Activates/deactivates selection (active learning engine)
	select:site-en-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for site energy equations in selection procedure
	select:energy-weight	1.0			# <double>	Weight for energy equation in selection procedure
	select:force-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for forces equations in selection procedure
	select:stress-weight	0.0			# <double>	Weight for stresses equations in selection procedure
	select:threshold		1.000001		# <double>	Selection threshold - maximum allowed extrapolation level
	select:save-selected	out/selected.cfg	# <string>	Selected configurations will be saved in this file after selection is complete. No configuration saving if not specified
	select:efs-ignored		TRUE	                # <bool>	Indicates that driver actually does not need EFS to be calculated (e.g. in fitting scenario). "TRUE" value may speed up processing by skipping some extra EFS calculations 
	select:log			stdout			# <string>	Where to write selection log. No logging if not specified; if "stdout" and "stderr" corresponds to standard output streams; otherwise log will be outputed to file with that name
